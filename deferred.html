<p>Imagine that a madman (we'll call him MadHatter) walks up to you and thrusts into your hand a FireCracker.  The FireCracker's internal Fuse is burning and will explode the firework in the next few seconds.
</p>
<p>
We will model this scenario using Asyncronous Python code.  This sort  of task is exactly what Twisted excels at, and we will write a Twisted implmentation of the scenario at the end of the article.  Before that, however, we will examine what components the task makes necessary in a general async event manager.  To this end we shall create our own event manager called Fate (don't worry, this will be very bare bones to fit in a few lines of code, yet suitable for the task we have set it).  You may have noticed that the pieces of the system I have described so far have names fitting into a real-life analogy.  This is a device to aid memory and understanding; I will make clear as we consider each part whether it is specific to our scenario, or applicable to a more general class of circumstances.  Hopefully the choice of naming will be helpful - Twisted also has interesting names, but ones which strangely have very little to do with the function of their bearers (see Conch, Manhole and Jelly). 
</p>
<p>
Enter the actors:
</p>



<pre class="example">class FireCracker(object):
    def __init__(self, owner):
        self.owner = owner
    def hand_to(self, new_owner):
        self.owner = new_owner
    def explode(self):
        print "BOOM! Firecracker exploded in the unlucky hands " \
            "of {0}".format(self.owner)

class MadHatter(object):
    pass

class BenEills(object):
    pass
</pre>


<p>
We've got this far using only the 'standard' everyday sort of Python.  No async magic.
</p>
<p>
Now, why is an event manager useful?  Why not simply continue in this vein?
</p>
<p>
Well, we want to be able to simulate th burning fuse.  Let's add a light<sub>fuse</sub>() method to FireCracker.  In na√Øve, syncronous Python we could do something like this:
</p>



<pre class="example">
def light_fuse(self):
    burning_time = random.choice([0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0])
    time.sleep(burning_time)
    self.explode()

</pre>


<p>
Do <b>not</b> do this!  Why?  There are two obvious issues:

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">



<p>
We shall now find a way around this by writing Fate() cna async code to use it.
</p>

<p>
In general, asyncronous programming could be summarized by replacing any blocking operation (e.g. sleeping, waiting for data on sockets, waiting or external command to return) with special event-handling commands.  By writing Fate, we will see that the blocking, clunky operations are in fact moved back behind the scenes into the event framework, which itnelligently combines them to give the illusion of simultaenous happenings.  They are merely being 'switched between'.  (Incidentally, this is similar to the way that modern operating systems allow you to run multiple applications at once by raidly switching between them behind-the-scenes).
</p>
<p>
On to Fate.  We have to provide a way for the developer working on the FireCracker code to 'set' events.  The simplest method of doing this is perhaps timer-based events.  Lets make a Fuse class that represents a timed event.  Just follow along, you'll see precisely how it fits together with everything else in a bit.
</p>



<pre class="example">class Fuse(object):
    def set_time(self, time):
        self.time = time
    def is_burned(self):
        return self.time &lt; time.time()
</pre>



<p>
So, this is simple.  We get a fuse, set the burning time and then we can check in the future whether or not it is fully burned.  It is a trifle whether to use '&lt;' or '&lt;=' - it is incredibly unlikely that this will make any difference in your Python implementation, due to the high precision of the Standard Library's time() call.  I have opted for the nicer-looking version, avoiding the perhaps philisophical issue of subdivision of time.
</p>
<p>
Now, the way that this will be incorporated into our code is as follows:
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> We will create Fate and add to it a get<sub>fuse</sub>() method.  This will take a single argument of the (floating point) number of seconds representing burning time.  It will add this to the current time, giving the absolute time at which the fuse will be fully burned, creates a Fuse instance and sets the time on it.  It saves this to internal instance memeory and returns it.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> We will add a light<sub>fuse</sub>() method to FireCracker.  This will get a Fuse using Fate.get<sub>fuse</sub>() and tell it what to do when the fuse is fully burned.  It will do this by simply calling its set<sub>handler</sub>() method with self.explode.  We are telling Fate how to handle the fuse being completely burned.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">




<p>
But wait.  Fuse doesn't have a set<sub>handler</sub>() method.  We're going to fix that presently, it was simply more convienient to present the material in this logical order.
</p>
<p>
The following is the whole of Fate, including the slightly expanded Fuse class.  It will be explained afterwards.  Try to glean the rough functionality from the source.
</p>



<pre class="example">class Fate(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._shutdown = False
        self.fuses = []

    def get_fuse(self, seconds):
        f = Fuse()
        f.set_time(time.time() + seconds)
        self.fuses.append(f)
        return f

    def check_fuses(self):
        for fuse in self.fuses:
            if fuse.has_handler() and fuse.is_burned():
                self.fuses.remove(fuse)
                fuse.call_handler()

    def run(self):
        while not self._shutdown:
            self.check_fuses()
            time.sleep(0.2)

    def shutdown(self):
        self._shutdown = True


class Fuse(object):
    def set_time(self, time):
        self.time = time
    def is_burned(self):
        return self.time &lt; time.time()
    def set_handler(self, handler):
        self.handler = handler
    def has_handler(self):
        return hasattr(self, 'handler')
    def call_handler(self):
        self.handler()
</pre>

<p>
Now, we'll fill in the bits of the FireCracker scenario to make use of Fate.  This will be a good example of how to use Fate for other applications, and, more generally, is illustrative of a standard asyncronous design pattern.  Remember that we're replacing the bad, syncronous version one of our light<sub>fuse</sub>() method with a better Fate-ful one.
</p>
<p>
Here is the complete FireCracker program, minus general-purpose Fate code and imports.
</p>



<pre class="example">class FireCracker(object):
    def __init__(self, owner, fate):
        self.owner = owner
        self.fate = fate
    def hand_to(self, new_owner):
        self.owner = new_owner
    def explode(self):
        print "BOOM! Firecracker exploded in the unlucky hands " \
            "of {0}".format(self.owner)
        # After any explosion, shutdown program after 2 second delay
        # Otherwise we'd have to kill the program
        f = self.fate.get_fuse(2)
        f.set_handler(self.fate.shutdown)
    def light_fuse(self):
        burning_time = random.choice([0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0])
        f = self.fate.get_fuse(burning_time)
        f.set_handler(self.explode)


class MadHatter(object):
    def __repr__(self):
        return "Mad Hatter"


class BenEills(object):
    def __repr__(self):
        return "Ben Eills"

# Universe come into existence
fate = Fate()
# Hatter and Ben are born
hatter = MadHatter()
ben = BenEills()
# FireCracker appears, intitially owned by the Hatter
fc = FireCracker(hatter, fate)
# The Hatter lights the fuse
fc.light_fuse()
# And hands it to Ben
fc.hand_to(ben)
# Universe begins paying attention to duration of time
# At some point during run, the FireCracker will explode
#   and 2 seconds later, Fate will be shutdown
fate.run()
# Universe has ended.  We have no cleanup to do.
