===========================================================================================
Ben Eills, 2012


Reading
=======

The main copy of this tutorial is hosted at
http://www.beneills.com/tutorials/deferreds/ , and the asociated files are
linked to from there.  This is the suggested version to read if you want to
learn about Python async programming, Twisted and Deferreds.

The development version is stored in a GitHub repository at 
https://github.com/beneills/deferreds .  This is intended to make it easy for
others to contribute, as well as it being a convienient place to store stuff.


Contributing
============

Please feel free to contribute via GitHub by cloning the repo and improving
stuff.  I'm not too familiar with GitHub, but I'm sure you can find a way to
message me with patches, or raise issues.

The main tutorial is written using Org Mode in Emacs, intended to be exported
to HTML.  This is the first time I've done web authoring using it, but it
seems to have worked pretty well.


Packaging
=========

Intended as a reminder to me of how to publish this on main website:
* Generate HTML document using Emacs
* Generate tar.gz of examples
* TODO

No permission is required to copy, distribute or modify any file distributed
